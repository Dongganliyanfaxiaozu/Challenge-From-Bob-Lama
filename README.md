# Challenge-From-Bob-Lama

To promote the accessibility on open source system. Bob Lama is a transcendental hypothetical role, he has only two figure can use, no visual impairment, an often-go-wrong hearingï¼Œ and no idea of any concept. Challenge-From-Bob-Lama means that,
once Bob Lama has a product set for a system, how such thing will performance to he and how such thing will made he.

The final is how can he use anything of open source.

## Example : On the Bootstrap of Linux

1. Bob Lama cannot has the idea of linux.
2. Bob Lama cannot power on the machine, for he may cannot position where the button is.
3. After press the power button, Bob Lama drop in an null-wolrd : he cannot know anything of how the machine is. Once the machine crash, the only situation is that a endless and anxious waiting.
4. He cannot know any steps of process while the machine starting up.
5. After the bootstrap, Bob Lama cannot know whether the machine is on prepare, so he don has a point to do his works.

Some Problem of Hacking this:

- The Completeness of the feedback of the machine
- The Control Flow By his two figure
