# Challenge-From-Bob-Lama

To promote the accessibility on open source system. Bob Lama is a transcendental hypothetical role, he has only two figure can use, no visual impairment, an often-go-wrong hearingï¼Œ and no idea of any concept. Challenge-From-Bob-Lama means that,
once Bob Lama has a product set for a system, how such thing will performance to he and how such thing will made he.

The final is how can he use anything of open source.

## Example : On the Bootstrap of Linux

1. Bob Lama cannot has the idea of linux.
2. Bob Lama cannot power on the machine, for he may cannot position where the button is.
3. After press the power button, Bob Lama drop in an null-wolrd : he cannot know anything of how the situation of his machine is. Once the machine crash, the only going is the endless and worried waiting.
4. He cannot know any steps of process while the machine starting up.
5. After the bootstrap, Bob Lama cannot know whether the machine is on prepare, so he even don't has a point to do his works.

----

Some Problem of Hacking this:

- The Completeness of the feedback of the machine
- The Control Flow By his two figure

## Example : On the Bootstrap of M\*\*\*\*s\*\*\* Windowds

1. Bob Lama may has a more idea on windows, for he friends may more windows user.
2. Bob Lama cannot power on the machine as like as in linux.
3. After press the power button, Bob Lama drop in an expectation for the windows booting music. However, this is not a null-world, it is a world with the single expectation.
4. He cannot know anything of how the situation of his machine is as like as in linux.
5. Once the machine crash, it means that we cannot hear the booting music for a long waiting time. (Thus, we almost can know that the machine is crash.)
6. He cannot know any steps of process while the machine starting up as like as in linux.
7. After the bootstrap, Bob Lama will hearing the sound of booting success, so he will know the point he can go to work.

We are not point any advantages or disadvantages of difference system, we just point out that: **From Challenge of Bob Lama, how the system will performance difference. **
